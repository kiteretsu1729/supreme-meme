### Nvidia's Year-on-Year Revenue Growth Rate and Revenue Analysis #### Year-on-Year Revenue Growth Rate To calculate Nvidia's year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth rate, we use the following formula: \[ \text{YoY Revenue Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{Revenue in 2022} - \text{Revenue in 2021}}{\text{Revenue in 2021}} \times 100 \] Given: - **Revenue in 2022**: $23,601 million - **Revenue in 2021**: $16,434 million \[ \text{YoY Revenue Growth Rate} = \frac{23,601 - 16,434}{16,434} \times 100 = 43.57\% \] Nvidia's revenue grew by **43.57%** from 2021 to 2022. #### Revenue Breakdown by Segment | Segment | 2022 Revenue (in millions USD) | 2021 Revenue (in millions USD) | Growth Rate (%) | |:------------|-------------------------------:|-------------------------------:|----------------:| | Data Center | 6,043 | 3,694 | 64 | | Client | 6,201 | 6,887 | -10 | | Gaming | 6,805 | 5,607 | 21 | | Embedded | 4,552 | 246 | Significant | - **Data Center**: Significant growth driven by higher sales of server processors. - **Client**: Decline due to challenging PC market conditions. - **Gaming**: Growth driven by increased demand for gaming console SoCs. - **Embedded**: Significant growth due to the acquisition of Xilinx. #### Geographic Revenue Distribution | Region | 2022 Revenue (in millions USD) | 2021 Revenue (in millions USD) | |:------------------------|-------------------------------:|-------------------------------:| | United States | 8,049 | 4,656 | | China (including Hong Kong) | 5,207 | 4,096 | | Japan | 4,177 | 2,381 | #### Revenue Visualization ![Nvidia Revenue Over the Past Few Years](https://agents.interiit-pathway.com/files/chart_20241208_040518.png) This chart visualizes Nvidia's revenue over the past few years, highlighting the trend in revenue growth. #### Source of Information The data and analysis are based on Nvidia's financial reports and segment performance data for the years 2021 and 2022.
